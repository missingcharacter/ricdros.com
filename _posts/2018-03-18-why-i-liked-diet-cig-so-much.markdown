## It was 1 sentence

`It's hard to be a punk while wearing a skirt` from their song
["tummy ache"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePnrP7sIH_c)

This sentence made so many things click for me.

In high school, I just wanted to attend a lot of punk rock concerts from local
bands In Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico. I remember a lot of my female
friends will be `"too pushy"` or `"annoying"` for asking us (their male friends)
to be at the concert first, or that we picked them up at their home and then go
to the event.

I clearly remember being the idiot telling them shit like:

```text
"it doesn't seem fair we have pick you up"
```

```text
"it doesn't seem fair you always want us (male friends) to be there first before
showing up"
```

I'm a little sad to say that until now, that I'm in my thirties, just realized
how much of an idiot I was. I was missing the context of them being girls in a
Mexican city, of course they were not comfortable with other males they didn't
know. I didn't know about the problems society had with them being high school
girls dressing the way we `"punks"` dressed like, showing skin, skirts, jeans
with holes, looking like we didn't take a bath, among other things.

Anyways, this may not have a lot to do with what the song was about, but it
really touched my heart.

Thanks [Diet Cig](https://dietcig.bandcamp.com/)!
